<p style=font-size:22px;color:black >Spicy, rich, flavourful and diverse are terms that are 
    frequently used to describe Indian food. All these words are apt in describing Indian 
    cuisine, for it is diverse in variety and taste, and is made up from a wide array of 
    regional cuisines throughout various parts of India.
<br>
    Due to the differences in climate and soil conditions, the local cuisines in various 
    regions may vary greatly from each other, as each region uses spices, herbs and ingredients
    that are grown locally. Culture, tradition and religion also play significant roles in 
    influencing the cuisines and diets of the Indians.

    North Indian VS. South Indian Cuisines          
    Here comes the oft-asked question: What is the difference between North Indian food and
    South Indian food?

       <p  style=font-size:52% class="w3-text-grey">
        Call me biased, but Rajasthani Thali is my favorite Indian Thali. It comes with the flavors of the desert that are dry and rich at the same time. Richness comes from oodles of desi ghee used. Some unique dishes to try in a Rajasthani Thali are:
        
        Dal Bati Churma – a true blue desert food
        Gatte ki Subzi – when the vegetables are not easily available, gram flour is used to make curry
        Ker Sangri – This is one indigenous wild plant that grows across the desert. You get both Sabzi and pickle from Ker Sangri
        Bajre ki Roti – Roti made of Bajra, usually drier than wheat roti, so eaten with a layer of Desi Ghee
        Lahsun ki Chutney – Garlic Chutney
        Khichdi – A multi-grain khichadi with Wheat, Bajra & Jowar
        Kadhi – although you find it in many menus, each region has its own recipe
        Roasted Papad>
        Ghevar – a traditional Rajasthani sweet dish, usually available in monsoon season.</p>

    <h1 style=color:Black><b>Gujrati Thali</b>
    <span style=font-size:62%; class="w3-right w3-tag w3-dark-grey w3-round">Rs.310.00 for half</span></h1>
    <img src="Guj.jpg" style=width:22% class="w3-rectangle w3-right">
    <p   style=font-size:52% class="w3-text-grey">Just like Indian meals, there are various variants of a Gujarati Thali. Kathiawadi Thali is particularly famous. Like Bengali Thali, Gujarati one is also quite sweet. It is incidental that the east and west of India has a similar fetish for sweet. However, in Gujarat, you find a generous flavor of garlic. Many dishes will have a pre-fix Lehsunia, which means ample garlic.
    
        Tamatar Shev ki Sabji – This is what defines a Gujarati Thali for me.
        Papad ki Subji – yes you can make a curry from Papad too
        Undhiyo – a version of Khichadi
        Kadhi
        Dhokla or Khandvi shine with their bright yellow color
        Small sized Rotis or Bhakris made of Bajra accompany the meal.
        Desi Ghee and Jaggery are used to give a finishing touch to the Gujarati Kathiawadi Thalii</p>

    <h1 style=color:Black><b>Maharashtrian Thali</b> 
    <span style=font-size:62%; class="w3-right w3-tag w3-dark-grey w3-round">Rs.225.50</span></h1>
    <img src="Maha.jpg" style=width:22%;height:180px px class="w3-rectangle w3-right">
    <p   style=font-size:52% class="w3-text-grey">Maharashtrians are known for their extremely spicy and unique masalas. Chicken and fish are the common non-veg items you’ll find here. They have a great variety of Pickles. The thali will have a little amount of rice in one corner with daal in a bowl, and chappati on the other corner. You can pick what comes to your plate. There are a variety of bhajis, sabudaana vada and the awesome pav bhaji, which is irresistible. With sweets like aamras and sheera, the thali is certainly not lacking when it comes to desserts.  Maharashtrian thali automatically goes up by a level.</p>

    <h1 style=color:Black><b>Bengali Thali </b> 
    <span  style=font-size:62%; class="w3-right w3-tag w3-dark-grey w3-round">Rs.310</span></h1>
    <img src="Ben.jpg" style=width:22%;height:180px class="w3-rectangle w3-right">
    <p   style=font-size:52% class="w3-text-grey">Vegetarian and Bengali sound bit of an oxymoron. However, to my delight, they do have a lot of options for vegetarians. There is no dearth of flavors or options for vegetarians. Bengalis like to add a bit of sweet in their food, so everything, except maybe rice has a tinge of sweetness in it.
    
        What makes a Bengali Thali is:
        
        Mishto Doi – Told you everything is sweet here & the sweet set curd is the most celebrated part of Bengali meal.
        Baingan Bhaja – Brinjal or Aubergine fries
        Aaloo Posto – Potato cooked with poppy seeds, a combination you find only in Bengal
        Luchi – It is like a small-sized Poori, but made with Maida, and tastes a bit different
        Rasgulla or Roshogulla – No Bengali Thali is complete without this favorite sweet of Kolkata.
        Daal, seasonal vegetables cooked in mustard oil and rice complete the menu.</p>

    <h1 style=color:Black></h1style><b>Goa Thali </b>
    <span  style=font-size:62% class="w3-right w3-tag w3-dark-grey w3-round">Rs.250.00</span></h1>
    <img src="Goa.jpg" style=width:22%;height:180px class="w3-rectangle w3-right">
    <p  style=font-size:52%  class="w3-text-grey">Yes, it is not impossible to get a vegetarian Thali in Goa. It is not easy but you do get it at many places. Remove all the non-vegetarian food from a Goan Thali and you are left with rice, salad & sol kadi.
    
        Now add shallowly fried, semolina soaked Phodi made with local vegetables including banana, roots, and breadfruit. That is the crispy element on the menu, found only in Goa.
        
        Add a seasonal vegetable in coconut curry.
        
        Daali Toye – a watery and rather bland version of the usual Daal.
        
        Add Tambri Bhaji or Patal Bhaji usually made with red leaves
        
        That is your Goan Vegetarian meal. </p>
